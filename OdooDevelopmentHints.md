###Aliasing a Model for successful SQL Query made through the ORM layer

An issue has been opened [here](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/45811) that describes the problem faced.

Odoo's ORM structure was found to alias the table name by the model name defined in the respective class (i.e. _name='my.example.model.name')

When a filter search  applied, an inner join statement of tables aliased with model names were being combined to a string that exceeded a size of 63 bytes which caused trruncation by Postgresql due to its defined limit for identifier name.

Hence, the truncations made by postgresql to the elongated alias name was causing the sql query to fail. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, adding a _table variable was suugested in the related issue.

Defining the SQL table name to be used in the query generated by the ORM of Odoo, by explicit specification through _table has resolved the problem.
